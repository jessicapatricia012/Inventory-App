# My Personal Project: Store Inventory Tracker

I am designing an application that keeps track of store inventory items. This includes keeping track of their stock, location in which they are stores, buy/sell prices, and suppliers. The app will also notify the user when an item is low in stock, and the user will be able to set the limit. 

This application will be most useful for store owners, who wants a record of their inventory items on an application. While a lot of similar programs are available out there, this application would be more suitable for smaller businesses that do have a lot of things going on in their inventory.

## User Story
-  As a user, I want to be able to add or remove an item to my inventory
-  As a user, I want to be able to update the stock of my items
-  As a user, I want to be able to view the information related to my item
-  As a user, I want to be able to be able to check the items with low stocks
