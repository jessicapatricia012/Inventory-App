# My Personal Project: Storage Inventory Tracker

I am designing an application that keeps track of storage inventory items. The app will let the user know when an item 
is low in stock, and the user will be able to set the limit. The user will also be able to register items going in 
or out of the inventory.

This program will be useful for storage or warehouse owner, who wants to be able to update their inventory everytime
an item is received or shipped out of the storage/warehouse.

## User Story
-  As a user, I want to be able to view the list of all items I have in my inventory
-  As a user, I want to be able to add or remove an item from my inventory
-  As a user, I want to be able to update the stock of my items everytime 
   an item is received or sent out from the storage
-  As a user, I want to be able to view the information related to my item and edit it
-  As a user, I want to be able to be able to check the items that has low stock
-  As a user, I want to be informed when a new item that is not yet registered in the inventory is received, 
   and register that new item.
-  As a user, I want to be informed when an item does not have enough stock to be shipped out
